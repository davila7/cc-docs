# Custom Slash Commands

You can create custom slash commands for your project by creating Markdown files in the `.claude/commands/` directory. The name of the file determines the name of the command.

For example, to create a `/hello` command, you would create a file named `.claude/commands/hello.md` with the following content:

```markdown
Hello, world!
```

You can also use arguments in your custom slash commands. For more information, see the [Slash commands documentation](../../chapter-2-core-concepts-and-common-workflows/2-slash-commands.md).
