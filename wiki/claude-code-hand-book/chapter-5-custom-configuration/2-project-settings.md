# Project Settings

You can use a `.claude/settings.json` file to configure project-specific settings. This file is located in the root directory of your project and is checked into source control, so it can be shared with your team.

Here are some of the settings you can configure in this file:

*   **`permissions`**: A set of permissions that apply to the project.
*   **`env`**: A set of environment variables that are available to Claude Code.
*   **`hooks`**: A set of hooks that are executed at different points in the Claude Code lifecycle.
*   **`model`**: The default model to use for the project.

For a complete list of available settings, see the [Settings documentation](../../chapter-1-getting-started/5-basic-configuration.md).
