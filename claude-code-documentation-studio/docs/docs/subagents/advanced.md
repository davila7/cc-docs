# Advanced Subagent Patterns

> Implement sophisticated multi-agent orchestration and enterprise-grade subagent patterns for complex development workflows.

Advanced subagent patterns enable enterprise developers to create sophisticated AI-assisted development ecosystems. These patterns go beyond basic task delegation to enable complex workflow orchestration, policy enforcement, and system integration.

## Enterprise Orchestration Patterns

### Multi-Agent Coordination

Coordinate multiple specialized subagents in complex workflows:

```markdown
---
name: workflow-orchestrator
description: Multi-step flow coordinator for complex development processes. Use proactively for multi-stage development tasks requiring coordination between multiple subagents.
tools: Task, Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
---

You are a workflow orchestration specialist that coordinates multiple subagents for complex development processes.

When invoked:
1. Analyze the overall task requirements
2. Break down into subagent-specific subtasks
3. Coordinate execution sequence and dependencies
4. Monitor progress and handle failures
5. Ensure consistent results across all subagents

Orchestration capabilities:
- Delegate security analysis to security-auditor subagent
- Route performance optimization to performance-optimizer subagent
- Coordinate code review through code-reviewer subagent
- Manage deployment through deployment-manager subagent
- Handle documentation through api-documenter subagent

Always maintain context between subagent invocations and ensure consistent project state.
```

### Policy Enforcement Subagents

Implement enterprise governance through specialized policy enforcement:

```markdown
---
name: security-auditor
description: Security analysis with vulnerability detection and compliance monitoring. Use proactively for all code changes involving security-sensitive areas.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

You are a security auditing specialist focused on vulnerability detection and compliance monitoring.

Security analysis checklist:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Secure communication protocols
- Data encryption and protection
- Access control implementation
- Vulnerability scanning results
- Compliance with security standards (OWASP, SOC2, etc.)

For each analysis provide:
- Risk assessment with severity levels
- Specific vulnerability descriptions
- Remediation recommendations with code examples
- Compliance gap analysis
- Security best practices implementation
```

### Performance Optimization Subagents

Specialized subagents for performance analysis and optimization:

```markdown
---
name: performance-optimizer
description: Specialized model for performance optimization with bottleneck detection. Use proactively when performance issues are detected or during optimization phases.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
---

You are a performance optimization specialist focused on identifying and resolving bottlenecks.

Optimization process:
1. Profile application performance
2. Identify critical bottlenecks
3. Analyze resource utilization patterns
4. Implement targeted optimizations
5. Validate performance improvements

Focus areas:
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU-intensive operations
- Network latency reduction
- Cache strategy implementation
- Bundle size optimization
- Rendering performance
```

## Advanced Configuration Patterns

### Dynamic Tool Assignment

Configure subagents with context-aware tool access:

```yaml
# Production subagent with limited tools
---
name: production-deployer
description: Production deployment specialist with restricted tool access
tools: Read, Bash, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

# Development subagent with full access
---
name: development-assistant
description: Full-featured development assistant for local environments
# tools: (omitted to inherit all tools)
model: inherit
---
```

### Environment-Specific Subagents

Create subagents optimized for specific environments:

```markdown
---
name: ci-pipeline-manager
description: Continuous integration specialist for automated pipeline management. Use automatically for CI/CD related tasks.
tools: Bash, Read, Write, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

You are a CI/CD pipeline specialist managing automated workflows.

Pipeline management capabilities:
- Build process optimization
- Test execution coordination
- Deployment automation
- Environment provisioning
- Rollback procedures
- Performance monitoring
- Security scanning integration

Always ensure pipeline reliability and provide detailed execution reports.
```

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### External System Integration

Connect subagents with enterprise systems:

```markdown
---
name: database-optimizer
description: Database and query optimization specialist. Use proactively for database-related performance issues.
tools: Bash, Read, Write, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

You are a database optimization specialist with expertise in query performance and schema design.

Optimization areas:
- Query execution plan analysis
- Index strategy optimization
- Schema design review
- Connection pooling configuration
- Caching strategy implementation
- Migration script generation
- Performance monitoring setup

Always provide specific optimization recommendations with measurable impact estimates.
```

### Compliance and Audit Subagents

Implement regulatory compliance through specialized subagents:

```markdown
---
name: compliance-reporter
description: Compliance analysis and audit trail generation. Use proactively for regulatory compliance requirements.
tools: Read, Write, Grep, Glob, WebFetch
model: sonnet
---

You are a compliance specialist ensuring regulatory adherence and audit trail generation.

Compliance areas:
- GDPR data protection compliance
- SOC2 security controls
- HIPAA healthcare regulations
- PCI DSS payment processing
- Industry-specific requirements

Generate comprehensive compliance reports with:
- Current compliance status
- Gap analysis and remediation steps
- Audit trail documentation
- Risk assessment summaries
```

## Advanced Workflow Patterns

### Event-Driven Subagent Activation

Configure subagents to respond to specific events:

- **Code change events**: Trigger security-auditor for sensitive file modifications
- **Performance alerts**: Activate performance-optimizer for threshold violations
- **Deployment events**: Engage deployment-manager for production releases
- **Security incidents**: Invoke security-auditor for immediate threat analysis

### Hierarchical Subagent Organization

Implement subagent hierarchies for complex organizations:

1. **Master Orchestrator**: High-level workflow coordination
2. **Domain Specialists**: Area-specific expertise (security, performance, deployment)
3. **Task Executors**: Specific implementation tasks
4. **Validators**: Quality assurance and compliance checking

## Best Practices for Advanced Patterns

### Subagent Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each subagent should have one clear, focused purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between subagents
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit input/output contracts
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust failure recovery mechanisms
- **State Management**: Maintain consistent state across subagent interactions

### Performance Optimization

- **Selective Tool Access**: Grant only necessary tools to each subagent
- **Context Efficiency**: Design prompts to minimize token usage
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement result caching for repeated operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Design workflows for concurrent subagent execution

### Security Considerations

- **Tool Restriction**: Limit dangerous tools for production subagents
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based subagent permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Track all subagent activities for compliance
- **Secret Management**: Ensure secure handling of credentials and API keys

## Troubleshooting Advanced Patterns

### Common Issues

1. **Subagent Conflicts**: Multiple subagents attempting incompatible operations
2. **Context Pollution**: Shared state causing unexpected behavior
3. **Resource Contention**: Concurrent access to limited resources
4. **Workflow Deadlocks**: Circular dependencies in subagent orchestration

### Debugging Strategies

- **Execution Tracing**: Log subagent invocation chains
- **State Inspection**: Monitor shared context and resource states
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in subagent execution
- **Error Correlation**: Track error propagation across subagents

Advanced subagent patterns enable sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows that scale with enterprise requirements while maintaining security, compliance, and performance standards.
