### Requirements
Before implementing this automated documentation system, ensure you have:
- Active Claude Code Account: Functional Claude Code installation with valid API access
- GitHub Repository: Repository with admin or write permissions where documentation will be managed
- GitHub Actions Access: Permissions to create and execute GitHub Actions workflows in your repository
- Anthropic API Key: Valid API key for Claude Code agent execution in CI/CD environment

### Resources
Core Documentation:
- Claude Code Agents
- Claude Code Hooks
- Docusaurus

Agent Templates:
- AITMPL Agent Repository
- Docusaurus Expert Agent

Integration:
- GitHub Actions
- Discord Webhooks

### Course Structure
- Stage 1: Agents
Configure three specialized agents: validation, GitHub integration, and Discord notification.
- Stage 2: Hooks
Implement pre-tool validation hooks and post-completion notification triggers.
- Stage 3: Workflow Integration
Deploy complete GitHub Actions pipeline with Discord notifications.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion, you will implement a production-ready automated documentation system that:
- Validates documentation quality before commits
- Generates updates via GitHub Actions using Claude Code agents
- Notifies teams through Discord of documentation changes
- Maintains synchronization between code and documentation automatically

This tutorial provides practical implementation of AI-driven development workflows for maintaining high-quality project documentation with minimal manual intervention.
