## Success Criteria

Developers working with Claude Code can independently implement advanced agent and hook patterns that solve real workflow problems in their projects, progressing from basic usage to sophisticated automation patterns that measurably improve their development efficiency.

**Measurement Method**: Success is validated when developers can execute the provided code samples, adapt them to their specific use cases, and demonstrate their implementations work correctly in their actual development environment - evidenced by functional GitHub repositories and working automation workflows that they can explain and troubleshoot independently.
