# Planning Document - Claude Code Agents and Hooks Advanced Integration Patterns

## Success Criteria (success-criteria.md)
<!-- How will you know you've created truly helpful content for developers working with advanced Claude Code workflows? Define measurable outcomes that indicate your documentation package successfully bridges the gap between basic usage and advanced optimization. -->

## Developer Needs Analysis (planning-document.md)
<!-- What does a developer need to know to make intelligent decisions about implementing your scenario? Identify the key knowledge gaps, decision points, and technical challenges that experienced developers face when working with agents and hooks. -->

## Content Structure
<!-- Plan and rationale for organizing your documentation and technical materials. Outline the logical flow of information, how different sections will connect, and why this structure best serves your target audience. -->

### Documentation Guide Structure
<!-- Break down the main documentation sections and explain the reasoning behind each -->

### Repository Structure
<!-- Outline how you'll organize your code samples, configuration files, and technical demonstrations -->

## Implementation Approach
<!-- What technical demonstrations will best illustrate the concepts? Describe the specific agents and hooks you plan to create, the workflows they'll demonstrate, and how they showcase advanced integration patterns. -->

### Planned Agents
<!-- List and briefly describe the custom agents you'll create -->

### Planned Hooks
<!-- List and briefly describe the advanced hooks you'll implement -->

### Integration Patterns
<!-- Describe the sophisticated workflow patterns you'll demonstrate -->

## Workflow Optimization Strategy
<!-- How will you address the gap between basic usage and advanced optimization? Explain your approach to showing progression from simple implementations to complex, production-ready patterns. -->

## Technical Depth Assessment
<!-- What level of implementation detail will convince an experienced developer that your approach is sound? Define the technical rigor and depth of explanation needed for your target audience. -->

## Code Architecture Rationale
<!-- How will you structure your code to be both educational and immediately useful to developers, including those with complex use cases? Explain your approach to creating code that teaches architectural principles while remaining practical. -->

## Timeline and Scope
<!-- Given the 6-hour constraint, outline what you'll prioritize and what you might leave as placeholders for future development -->

### Priority 1 (Must Have - First 4 hours)
<!-- Core deliverables that must be completed -->

### Priority 2 (Should Have - Next 2 hours)
<!-- Important additions if time permits -->

### Priority 3 (Future Development)
<!-- Areas you would expand given more time -->
