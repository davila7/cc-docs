# Technical Documentation and Content
## Engineer, Claude Code Take Home

# Intro
This take-home assignment is designed to assess your skills in technical writing, developer
education, and your deep understanding of Claude Code workflows and best practices. You'll
be creating a comprehensive documentation package that addresses one of Claude Code's most
challenging implementation areas.

If you decide to put in more than 6 hours on this take-home assignment, please clearly note the
content that was created before the 6-hour mark. If helpful, feel free to add notes in places
where if you had more time, you'd want to elaborate or build more in a specific area. Feel free
to use summarizing techniques like bullet point lists too, if it helps to keep your answer
concise.

Note: You are encouraged to use Claude to help you in any way you would like, as one of the role's
core responsibilities is to better integrate Claude into content creation workflows. You will not be
assessed by how much or how little you use Claude, but rather by the quality of your final set of
submitted materials (and of any placeholder summaries that you would further expand given
more time). If you do decide to use Claude, explaining how you use Claude can only help, not
harm, your application. To that end, please document your use of Claude and include the
entire transcript of your Claude Code, Claude.ai, and other Claude conversations. If
the transcript does not comprehensively cover all the ways you used Claude, please
include all relevant content.

# Background
Claude Code represents a revolutionary approach to AI-assisted development, enabling
developers to delegate complex coding tasks directly from their terminal. While basic Claude
Code usage is documented, advanced workflow optimization and enterprise deployment
scenarios remain challenging areas where developers need comprehensive guidance.

# IMPORTANT: TASK
## Claude Code Agents and Hooks - Advanced Integration Patterns
Claude Code's agents and hooks commands enable sophisticated development workflows that
go beyond basic code generation. This scenario focuses on building custom agents,
implementing advanced hooks, and creating reusable patterns for complex development
scenarios.

Your task: Create a documentation package for advanced Claude Code agents and hooks
commands covering custom agent creation, hooks that power complex workflows, and patterns
for building sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows. Your documentation package
must include sample implementation code that you think best demonstrates these concepts.

# Submission Requirements
## Submission Format
● Scenario and choice justification: Your chosen scenario, and 2-3 sentences explaining
why you chose your scenario and any relevant experience related to that scenario
● Planning document: Brief outline of your documentation strategy (see
Recommended Approach: Phase 1)
● Documentation package (see Documentation Package Requirements):
○ Main documentation: Comprehensive guide in your preferred format
○ GitHub repository: Working implementation with code samples,
configuration files, and technical demonstrations

## Documentation Package Requirements
Your documentation package should include two parts:
1. A comprehensive documentation guide that covers the advanced concepts,
implementation patterns, and best practices for your chosen scenario
2. A working technical implementation (code samples, configuration files, or reference
implementation) that demonstrates these concepts in action and includes:
a. Functional code samples that can be executed and tested (not just snippets)
b. Clear examples showing both successful patterns and common pitfalls
c. Practical demonstrations of the workflows you're documenting
d. Your implementation should go beyond basic examples to demonstrate
sophisticated workflow patterns, including proper error handling, performance
considerations, and, if applicable, agent architecture and context management
decisions that others can learn from and adapt.

The documentation should be structured to help experienced developers successfully
implement your chosen scenario in their development workflows. Consider including:
● Workflow overview: High-level process patterns and decision frameworks
● Implementation guide: Step-by-step technical implementation with practical
examples
● Best practices: Context management, prompting strategies, and optimization
techniques
● Troubleshooting guide: Common issues and resolution approaches
● Measurement strategies: How to evaluate effectiveness and optimize workflows

## Recommended Approach
### Phase 1: Planning
Write a brief outline of your documentation strategy for your chosen scenario. This outline
should include both what content you're creating, as well as why. Some things to consider:
● Success criteria: How will you know you've created truly helpful content for
developers working with advanced Claude Code workflows?
● Developer needs analysis: What does a developer need to know to make intelligent
decisions about implementing your scenario?
● Content structure: Plan and rationale for organizing your documentation and
technical materials
● Implementation approach: What technical demonstrations will best illustrate the
concepts?
● Workflow optimization: How will you address the gap between basic usage and
advanced optimization?
● Technical depth assessment: What level of implementation detail will convince an
experienced developer that your approach is sound?
● Code architecture rationale: How will you structure your code to be both
educational and immediately useful to developers, including those with complex use
cases?

### Phase 2: Documentation Development
Create your comprehensive documentation package including:
● Main documentation guide in your preferred format
● GitHub repository with working implementation, code samples, and configuration
examples
● Include diagrams, workflow visualizations, screencasts, or process charts as appropriate
We understand that time is tight, so if your plan is ambitious, we encourage you to flesh out the
parts that best exemplify your expertise with Claude Code and your skills as a technical
documentation engineer. For other sections, you can write placeholder explanations for what
you would further develop given more time.
A note on technical expectations

At Anthropic, our technical documentation engineers work with highly complex production
code and receive limited direct engineering support due to team bandwidth. As such, this role
requires independently understanding complex production codebases to create accurate
documentation. And while your primary output is documentation, you'll need to demonstrate
that you can read, understand, and explain sophisticated code architectures without extensive
guidance from engineering teams.

The best technical documentation comes from truly understanding the code. Through your
implementation examples and explanations, show us that you can:
● Navigate and understand complex, multi-file codebases
● Identify architectural patterns and explain why they matter
● Anticipate where developers will struggle based on code complexity
● Create examples that demonstrate you've grasped non-obvious technical concepts
