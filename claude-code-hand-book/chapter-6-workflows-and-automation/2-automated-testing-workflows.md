# Automated Testing Workflows

You can use Claude Code to create automated testing workflows that run your tests, analyze the results, and even fix broken tests.

Here is an example of how you can use Claude Code to create an automated testing workflow:

1.  **Create a script that runs your tests.** This script should run your tests and output the results to a file.
2.  **Create a custom slash command that runs the script.** This slash command will run the script and pass the results to Claude Code.
3.  **Create a custom subagent that analyzes the test results.** This subagent will analyze the test results and provide a summary of the test run.
4.  **Create a custom hook that runs the slash command after every commit.** This hook will run the slash command after every commit, so you can get immediate feedback on your changes.

By following these steps, you can create an automated testing workflow that helps you catch bugs early and improve the quality of your code.
