# Automated Refactoring Workflows

You can use Claude Code to create automated refactoring workflows that refactor your code and improve its quality.

Here is an example of how you can use Claude Code to create an automated refactoring workflow:

1.  **Create a script that refactors your code.** This script should refactor your code according to a set of predefined rules.
2.  **Create a custom slash command that runs the script.** This slash command will run the script and pass the refactored code to Claude Code.
3.  **Create a custom subagent that reviews the refactored code.** This subagent will review the refactored code for errors and inconsistencies.
4.  **Create a custom hook that runs the slash command on a regular basis.** This hook will run the slash command on a regular basis, so you can keep your code clean and maintainable.
