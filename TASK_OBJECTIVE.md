# Claude Code Take Home Assignment - Task Objective

## Main Objective
Create a comprehensive documentation package for **Claude Code Agents and Hooks - Advanced Integration Patterns** that covers:
- Custom agent creation
- Advanced hooks implementation
- Sophisticated AI-assisted development workflows
- Reusable patterns for complex development scenarios

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Planning (Required Deliverable)
- [ ] Write scenario choice justification (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Create planning document outlining documentation strategy
- [ ] Define success criteria and developer needs analysis
- [ ] Plan content structure and implementation approach

### Phase 2: Documentation Package (Required Deliverables)

#### 1. Comprehensive Documentation Guide
- **Workflow overview**: High-level process patterns and decision frameworks
- **Implementation guide**: Step-by-step technical implementation with examples
- **Best practices**: Context management, prompting strategies, optimization techniques
- **Troubleshooting guide**: Common issues and resolution approaches
- **Measurement strategies**: How to evaluate effectiveness and optimize workflows

#### 2. Working Technical Implementation (GitHub Repository)
- **Functional code samples**: Executable and testable (not just snippets)
- **Configuration files**: Complete setup examples
- **Practical demonstrations**: Real workflow examples
- **Advanced patterns**: Error handling, performance considerations, agent architecture
- **Common pitfalls**: Examples showing what to avoid

## Key Requirements
- Target audience: Experienced developers
- Focus on advanced workflows beyond basic usage
- Include sophisticated patterns with proper error handling
- Demonstrate deep understanding of Claude Code architecture
- Time limit: 6 hours (clearly mark content created within this timeframe)

## Success Criteria
- Enables experienced developers to successfully implement advanced Claude Code workflows
- Bridges gap between basic usage and advanced optimization
- Demonstrates understanding of complex, multi-file codebases
- Shows architectural patterns and explains their importance
- Anticipates developer struggles based on code complexity

## Technical Expectations
- Navigate and understand complex codebases independently
- Create examples demonstrating non-obvious technical concepts
- Show ability to work with production-level code complexity
- Minimal engineering support assumption (requires self-sufficiency)
