## 🎤 Handling Common Questions

### "How long to complete the full course?"
**Answer:** "12-14 weeks with proper resourcing. Module 1 can pilot in weeks. Modules 1-3 (core proficiency) in 6 weeks."

### "Can we customize for enterprises?"
**Answer:** "Absolutely. Modular design allows emphasizing enterprise modules (5-6), custom capstone projects, company-specific examples."

### "What's different from documentation?"
**Answer:** "Documentation is a reference manual. This is a structured learning journey with assessments, feedback, and measurable outcomes. Driver's ed vs car manual."

### "How do we keep current?"
**Answer:** "Learning outcomes are stable - about capabilities, not specific commands. Modular resources can be updated. Core instructional design is evergreen."

### "Expected completion rate?"
**Answer:** "Target 80%+ with this structure. Traditional online courses see 10-15%. The hands-on approach and immediate feedback drive engagement."
