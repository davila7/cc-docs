**Presenter Guide for Education Lead Meeting**

---

## SLIDE 1: Introduction (2-3 minutes)

### Opening
"Thank you for the opportunity to present Claude Code Academy - a comprehensive training program we've designed to transform developers into AI-assisted programming experts."

### Key Points to Emphasize

**The Challenge We're Addressing:**
- Developers want to use Claude Code but lack structured learning paths
- Documentation exists, but developers need guided learning with assessments
- Teams need standardized training for enterprise adoption

**Our Solution:**
- 24-30 hour comprehensive course (flexible: self-paced or 5-day intensive)
- Targets developers at all levels - junior through senior
- 80% hands-on, project-based learning - not just theory

**What Makes This Different:**
- Built on proven educational frameworks, not just assembled documentation
- Clear learning outcomes with measurable success criteria
- Complete learning journey: installation â†’ enterprise deployment

### Transition
"Let me show you the rigorous methodology behind this course design..."

## SLIDE 2: Educational Methodology (3-4 minutes)

### Opening
"We didn't just create content - we engineered a learning experience using three proven educational frameworks."

### Framework 1: Backward Design

**Explain Simply:**
"Think of building a house - you don't start with the walls, you start with the blueprint. Backward Design means we:
1. First defined what learners should be able to DO
2. Then designed assessments to measure those abilities
3. Finally created activities that prepare them for success"

**Key Benefit:**
"This ensures everything aligns - no wasted time on irrelevant content."

### Framework 2: Outcome-Based Education (OBE)

**Explain Simply:**
"Every single component has a measurable outcome. We're not teaching 'about Claude Code' - we're teaching developers to EXECUTE specific tasks."

**Example:**
"Not 'understand prompting' but 'design effective prompts that generate production-quality code for specific use cases.'"

**Key Benefit:**
"Learners and managers can measure actual skill acquisition, not just completion."

### Framework 3: Bloom's Taxonomy

**Explain Simply:**
"We progressively develop cognitive skills:
- Start: Remember commands, understand workflows
- Middle: Apply prompting, analyze code quality
- Advanced: Evaluate approaches, create automation systems"

**Visual if needed:**
"Picture a staircase - each module builds on the previous, systematic progression from novice to expert."

### Transition
"This methodology is reflected in our 8-module structure..."

---

## SLIDE 3: Course Architecture (3-4 minutes)

### Opening
"The course has 9 components total - 8 modules plus a capstone project. They're organized in 4 tiers of increasing complexity."

### Walk Through Each Tier

**FOUNDATION (Modules 1-2):**
- "Everyone starts here - installation through core workflows"
- "Module 1 is complete and ready for pilot testing"
- "These modules ensure everyone has the same baseline"

**MASTERY (Modules 3-4):**
- "Here we go deeper - optimizing prompts, ensuring quality"
- "This is where developers become truly effective with AI assistance"
- "Critical modules - the difference between using a tool and mastering it"

**ADVANCED (Modules 5-6):**
- "This is where we unlock Claude Code's full power"
- "Customization with subagents, enterprise integration"
- "Teams and organizations - this is your tier"

**EXPERT (Modules 7-8):**
- "For developers who want to build on top of Claude Code"
- "SDK development, security, and best practices"
- "Prepare for leadership roles in AI-assisted development"

**SYNTHESIS (Module 9):**
- "The capstone brings it all together"
- "Learners build a complete automation system"
- "This becomes their portfolio piece"

### Flexibility Point
"Flexible delivery: 5-day intensive for teams, or self-paced over 6-8 weeks for individuals."

### Transition
"Each module is anchored by specific learning outcomes..."

---

## SLIDE 4: Learning Outcomes (3 minutes)

### Opening
"We have 5 course-level outcomes - think of these as the 5 core competencies every Claude Code expert needs."

### Walk Through Each CLO

**CLO 1: Command Execution**
- "Can they actually use Claude Code in their daily work?"
- "Not just demo scenarios - real projects, real workflows"

**CLO 2: Prompt Design**
- "This is the art and science of AI-assisted development"
- "Knowing how to ask to get what you need"

**CLO 3: Code Evaluation**
- "Critical skill: Can they spot issues in AI-generated code?"
- "Security, performance, quality - they need to be the expert reviewer"

**CLO 4: Workflow Integration**
- "Claude Code doesn't exist in isolation"
- "Can they integrate it into CI/CD, team workflows, existing processes?"

**CLO 5: Advanced Automation**
- "This is mastery - creating custom solutions"
- "Subagents, hooks, SDK - building on the platform"

### The Granularity
"Each module breaks these down further - 2-4 learning outcomes per module, each with 3-5 specific achievement indicators."

### Example (if time):
"For instance, in Module 1, we don't just say 'install Claude Code' - we specify:
- Successfully installs using npm or native installer
- Authenticates with correct account type
- Verifies installation
- Explains the difference between account types"

### Transition
"How do we measure all this? Through comprehensive assessment..."

---

## SLIDE 5: Assessment Strategy (3-4 minutes)

### Opening
"Assessment isn't an afterthought - it's built into the learning journey."

### Formative Assessment (During Learning)

**Explain:**
- "These are checkpoints, not gatekeepers"
- "Hands-on exercises after each lesson"
- "Self-assessment - learners track their own progress"
- "Immediate feedback - they know right away if they got it"

**Benefit:**
"Learners can't fall behind without knowing it. They always know where they stand."

### Summative Assessment (Module End)

**Explain:**
- "Each module ends with a real-world project"
- "Not multiple choice - actual coding scenarios"
- "Build something they can show in their portfolio"

**Example:**
"Module 2 assessment: Here's a codebase with 3 bugs and 2 feature requests - fix and implement using Claude Code. Just like their actual job."

### Capstone Project

**Emphasize This:**
"The capstone is where everything comes together:
- They build a complete automation system
- CI/CD pipeline with Claude Code
- Custom subagents for their team
- Security controls
- Full documentation and presentation"

**Value Proposition:**
"This becomes proof of mastery - they can show this to their team or in interviews."

### Rubrics
"Every assessment has detailed rubrics - learners and instructors know exactly what success looks like."

### Transition
"So where are we now? Let me show you our progress..."
