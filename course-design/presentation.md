# Slide 1: Introduction

## Claude Code Academy
### Transforming Developers into AI-Assisted Programming Experts

**Course Overview**
- **Duration:** 24-30 hours (self-paced) / 5 days (intensive)
- **Target Audience:** Software developers (junior to senior level)
- **Structure:** 8 progressive modules + capstone project
- **Approach:** 80% hands-on, project-based learning

**Key Outcomes**
- Execute Claude Code commands effectively in production workflows
- Design optimal prompts for AI-assisted development
- Evaluate and ensure quality of AI-generated code
- Integrate Claude Code into team and enterprise environments
- Build advanced automation with subagents, hooks, and SDK

# Slide 2: Educational Methodology

## Rigorous Instructional Design Framework

### 1. **Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe)**
Three-stage approach ensuring alignment:
- **Stage 1:** Define clear, measurable learning outcomes
- **Stage 2:** Design assessments that measure those outcomes
- **Stage 3:** Create learning activities that prepare for assessments

### 2. **Outcome-Based Education (OBE)**
Every component focused on demonstrable results:
- **Learning Outcomes (LOs):** Observable, measurable skills
- **Achievement Indicators (AIs):** Specific performance criteria
- **Continuous Assessment:** Formative and summative evaluation

### 3. **Bloom's Taxonomy Progression**
Systematic cognitive development:
- **Remember/Understand** (Modules 1-2): Commands, workflows
- **Apply/Analyze** (Modules 3-4): Prompting, testing, evaluation
- **Evaluate** (Modules 5-6): Customization, team integration
- **Create** (Modules 7-9): SDK development, complete systems

# Slide 4: Learning Outcomes Architecture

## Course-Level Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

**CLO 1: Command Execution**
Execute Claude Code commands and operations effectively **in real-world development workflows** to delegate tasks and automate work.

**CLO 2: Prompt Design**
Design effective prompts and task specifications **for AI-assisted development** to achieve precise, high-quality outcomes.

**CLO 3: Code Evaluation**
Evaluate AI-generated code **against quality, security, and performance standards** to ensure production readiness.

**CLO 4: Workflow Integration**
Integrate Claude Code **into existing pipelines and team workflows** to enhance productivity and maintain standards.

**CLO 5: Advanced Automation**
Create advanced automation **using subagents, hooks, and SDK** to optimize workflows and enforce best practices.

### Each module has 2-4 specific LOs with 3-5 Achievement Indicators

# Slide 5: Assessment Strategy

## Comprehensive Evaluation Framework

### **Formative Assessments** (Throughout)
- Hands-on coding exercises after each lesson
- Self-assessment checkpoints
- Practice tasks with immediate feedback
- Peer code reviews
- Progressive skill-building challenges

### **Summative Assessments** (End of modules)
- **Module Projects:** Real-world scenarios demonstrating LOs
- **Practical Demonstrations:** Live coding and problem-solving
- **Portfolio Building:** Collection of AI-assisted work

### **Capstone Project** (Final Assessment)
Complete automation system including:
- CI/CD pipeline with Claude Code
- Custom subagents and extensions
- Team collaboration features
- Security and compliance implementation
- SDK-based custom tooling

**Evaluation:** Detailed rubrics aligned with all learning outcomes

# Slide 6: Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Progress

### âœ… **Completed**
- **Complete learning plan** with all LOs and AIs (59KB document)
- **Educational framework** following Backward Design, OBE, Bloom's
- **Module 1 fully developed** (8 lessons + assessment with rubric)
- **All 9 module structures** defined with READMEs

### ðŸ”„ **In Progress**
- Module 2-9 lesson content development
- Resource materials and examples
- Instructor facilitation guide

### ðŸ“Š **Metrics**
