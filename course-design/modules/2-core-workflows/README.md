# Module 2: Core Development Workflows

**Duration:** 4-5 hours
**Prerequisites:** Module 1

## Module Overview

This module teaches you to leverage Claude Code for essential development workflows including feature implementation, debugging, version control, and code refactoring. You'll learn to work efficiently with AI assistance on real-world development tasks.

## Learning Outcomes

**LO 2.1:** **Implement** new features and functionality **using natural language task descriptions** to generate production-quality code efficiently.

**LO 2.2:** **Debug** and fix code issues **by delegating problem analysis and resolution to Claude Code** to quickly resolve bugs and errors.

**LO 2.3:** **Manage** version control operations **through conversational Git commands** to maintain clean commit history and collaboration workflows.

**LO 2.4:** **Refactor** existing code **using Claude Code** to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability without changing functionality.

## Achievement Indicators

**For LO 2.1:**
- AI 2.1.1: Writes clear, specific feature descriptions that lead to accurate implementations
- AI 2.1.2: Reviews and validates AI-generated code before approval
- AI 2.1.3: Iteratively refines implementations through follow-up prompts
- AI 2.1.4: Breaks down complex features into manageable sub-tasks
- AI 2.1.5: Verifies that generated code follows project conventions and patterns

**For LO 2.2:**
- AI 2.2.1: Provides error messages and stack traces to Claude Code for analysis
- AI 2.2.2: Describes bug symptoms clearly to enable accurate diagnosis
- AI 2.2.3: Reviews proposed fixes for root cause resolution vs symptom treatment
- AI 2.2.4: Requests test cases to prevent regression of fixed bugs
- AI 2.2.5: Validates fixes in development environment before accepting

**For LO 2.3:**
- AI 2.3.1: Uses Claude Code to check repository status and changes
- AI 2.3.2: Creates meaningful commits with descriptive messages via Claude Code
- AI 2.3.3: Manages branches using conversational commands
- AI 2.3.4: Resolves merge conflicts with Claude Code assistance
- AI 2.3.5: Follows team Git workflows while using Claude Code

**For LO 2.4:**
- AI 2.4.1: Identifies code that needs refactoring and clearly communicates requirements
- AI 2.4.2: Ensures refactored code maintains identical functionality
- AI 2.4.3: Improves code readability, structure, and adherence to best practices
- AI 2.4.4: Validates refactoring through existing tests or new test cases
- AI 2.4.5: Requests explanations of refactoring decisions and trade-offs

## Summative Assessment

**Project:** Bug Fix and Feature Implementation Challenge

Work with a project containing bugs and feature requirements:
1. Debug and fix 3 bugs of varying complexity
2. Implement 2 new features from specifications
3. Refactor one section of legacy code
4. Create proper Git commits for all changes
5. Document the process and decisions
