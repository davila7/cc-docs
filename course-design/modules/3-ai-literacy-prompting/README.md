# Module 3: AI Literacy and Effective Prompting

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Prerequisites:** Module 2

## Module Overview

This module develops your AI literacy and prompting skills for effective AI-assisted development. You'll learn to craft precise prompts, understand AI capabilities and limitations, critically evaluate AI-generated code, and iteratively refine outputs to achieve optimal solutions.

## Learning Outcomes

**LO 3.1:** **Craft** precise and effective prompts **for diverse coding tasks** to maximize the quality and accuracy of AI-generated solutions.

**LO 3.2:** **Analyze** AI capabilities and limitations **in software development contexts** to make informed decisions about when to use AI assistance.

**LO 3.3:** **Evaluate** AI-generated code **against functional, security, and performance criteria** to ensure production readiness.

**LO 3.4:** **Apply** iterative refinement techniques **to improve AI outputs** to transform initial responses into optimal solutions.

## Summative Assessment

**Project:** Prompt Engineering Portfolio

Create a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating prompting mastery:
1. Create 10 prompts covering different task types (feature, debug, refactor, test, docs)
2. For each prompt, show initial response and refined outcome
3. Analyze what made prompts effective or ineffective
4. Demonstrate iterative refinement on 3 complex tasks
5. Document AI limitations encountered and workarounds used
6. Create a personal prompt library for common tasks
