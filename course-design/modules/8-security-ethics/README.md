# Module 8: Security, Ethics, and Best Practices

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Prerequisites:** All previous modules

## Module Overview

This module addresses critical security, ethical, and compliance considerations for AI-assisted development. You'll learn to implement security best practices, apply ethical guidelines, configure privacy controls, and evaluate AI-generated code for vulnerabilities to ensure responsible and secure use of Claude Code.

## Learning Outcomes

**LO 8.1:** **Implement** security best practices **when using Claude Code** to protect sensitive data, credentials, and intellectual property.

**LO 8.2:** **Apply** ethical guidelines **for AI-assisted development** to ensure responsible use of AI in software engineering.

**LO 8.3:** **Configure** privacy and data controls **in Claude Code** to comply with organizational policies and regulations.

**LO 8.4:** **Evaluate** AI-generated code **for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues** to maintain secure and compliant codebases.

2. Identify and document 10 potential security risks
3. Implement security controls and mitigations
4. Configure privacy and data controls for compliance
5. Create security guidelines for team Claude Code usage
6. Review AI-generated code for vulnerabilities
7. Implement automated security checks (hooks, CI)
8. Conduct ethical review of AI usage in projects
9. Document compliance with relevant regulations
10. Present findings and recommendations
