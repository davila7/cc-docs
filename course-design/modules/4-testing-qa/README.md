# Module 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Prerequisites:** Module 2, Module 3

## Module Overview

This module teaches you to leverage Claude Code for comprehensive testing and quality assurance. You'll learn to generate test suites, debug failing tests, implement test-driven development workflows, and maintain high code quality through automated testing and analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

**LO 4.1:** **Generate** comprehensive test suites **using Claude Code** to ensure code quality and catch regressions.

**LO 4.2:** **Debug** failing tests **with AI assistance** to quickly identify and resolve test failures.

**LO 4.3:** **Implement** test-driven development (TDD) workflows **using Claude Code** to build features with tests guiding development.

**LO 4.4:** **Validate** code quality **through automated testing and analysis** to maintain high standards across the codebase.

## Achievement Indicators

**For LO 4.1:**
- AI 4.1.1: Generates unit tests with appropriate coverage for functions and modules
- AI 4.1.2: Creates integration tests that verify component interactions
- AI 4.1.3: Writes edge case and error handling tests
- AI 4.1.4: Ensures tests are independent, repeatable, and maintainable
- AI 4.1.5: Uses appropriate testing frameworks and assertion libraries

**For LO 4.2:**
- AI 4.2.1: Provides test failure output to Claude Code for analysis
- AI 4.2.2: Identifies whether failures are due to code or test issues
- AI 4.2.3: Fixes broken tests while preserving test intent
- AI 4.2.4: Updates tests when requirements change legitimately
- AI 4.2.5: Prevents regression by adding tests for fixed bugs

**For LO 4.3:**
- AI 4.3.1: Writes failing tests first to define expected behavior
- AI 4.3.2: Implements minimal code to make tests pass
- AI 4.3.3: Refactors code while maintaining passing tests
- AI 4.3.4: Uses red-green-refactor cycle effectively
- AI 4.3.5: Balances test coverage with development speed

**For LO 4.4:**
- AI 4.4.1: Runs test suites and interprets results
- AI 4.4.2: Uses linters and static analysis tools via Claude Code
- AI 4.4.3: Measures and improves code coverage
- AI 4.4.4: Validates code against quality metrics
- AI 4.4.5: Integrates quality checks into development workflow

## Summative Assessment

**Project:** Test Suite Development and Quality Assurance

Work with an untested codebase to build comprehensive quality assurance:
1. Analyze provided codebase (moderate complexity, no tests)
2. Design comprehensive test strategy
3. Generate unit tests for all modules using Claude Code
4. Create integration tests for key workflows
5. Implement TDD for one new feature
6. Fix 5 intentionally failing tests
7. Achieve 80%+ code coverage
8. Run static analysis and fix identified issues
