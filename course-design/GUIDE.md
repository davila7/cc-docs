# Course Design Prompt: Claude Code Academy

## Context
You are an expert instructional designer specializing in technical education and 
software development training. You will design a complete course structure for 
"Claude Code Academy" - a comprehensive training program for developers learning 
to use Claude Code, Anthropic's command-line tool for agentic coding.

## Target Audience
- Software developers and engineers (junior to senior level)
- Technical professionals learning to integrate AI into their workflow
- Students in computer science and software engineering programs
- Developers familiar with command-line tools and version control

## Educational Framework Requirements

### 1. Backward Design Methodology
Apply Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe's three-stage approach:

**Stage 1: Identify Desired Results**
- Define clear, measurable learning outcomes (LOs) for the entire course
- Establish essential questions that drive the learning experience
- Identify what learners should understand, know, and be able to do

**Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence**
- Design summative assessments (final projects, practical demonstrations)
- Create formative assessments (checkpoints, practice exercises)
- Define success criteria and performance indicators

**Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences**
- Design active, hands-on activities aligned with assessments
- Structure progressive skill-building exercises
- Create real-world coding scenarios and challenges

### 2. Outcome-Based Education (OBE)
Structure all content around demonstrable outcomes:

**Learning Outcomes (LOs) must:**
- Focus on what learners will be able to DO after completing the course
- Be observable, measurable, and assessable
- Include three components:
  - **Action verb** (observable, present tense)
  - **Object** (what the learner acts upon)
  - **Condition/Context** (how, where, under what circumstances, for what purpose)

**Achievement Indicators (AIs) must:**
- Break down each LO into specific, granular performance descriptors
- Describe concrete evidence of learning
- Cover cognitive, procedural, and attitudinal dimensions
- Be directly observable and measurable

### 3. Bloom's Taxonomy Integration
Ensure learning progression through cognitive levels:

**Knowledge Levels to Address:**
- **Remember**: Recall Claude Code commands, syntax, basic concepts
- **Understand**: Explain how Claude Code works, interpret responses
- **Apply**: Use Claude Code for specific coding tasks
- **Analyze**: Debug issues, evaluate AI-generated code quality
- **Evaluate**: Assess when to use Claude Code vs. traditional methods
- **Create**: Design complex workflows, integrate into development pipelines

**Structure learning activities to progress through these levels systematically**

## Course Structure Requirements

### Module Organization
Design 6-8 progressive modules, each containing:

1. **Module Overview**
   - Module title and description
   - Estimated time to complete
   - Prerequisites

2. **Learning Outcomes (LOs)**
   - 2-4 clear LOs per module
   - Each LO must include: action verb + object + condition/context
   - Use Bloom's taxonomy appropriate verbs

3. **Achievement Indicators (AIs)**
   - 3-5 specific AIs per LO
   - Describe observable behaviors that demonstrate mastery
   - Include performance criteria

4. **Summative Assessment**
   - Final module project or practical exam
   - Clear rubric aligned with LOs and AIs
   - Real-world coding challenge

5. **Formative Assessments**
   - Checkpoint exercises throughout the module
   - Self-assessment questions
   - Practice tasks with immediate feedback

6. **Learning Activities**
   - Structured as: Introduction → Development → Closure
   - Hands-on coding exercises
   - Problem-solving scenarios
   - Collaborative tasks (where applicable)

7. **Learning Resources**
   - Official documentation references
   - Video tutorials
   - Code examples and templates
   - Additional reading materials

## Content Areas to Cover

### Technical Skills
- Claude Code installation and setup
- Basic command syntax and operations
- Project delegation and task specification
- Code generation and modification

## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessments (throughout)
- Hands-on coding exercises
- Command-line challenges
- Code review activities
- Reflective questions
- Peer code evaluation

### Summative Assessments (end of modules/course)
- Complete coding projects using Claude Code
- Real-world problem-solving scenarios
- Portfolio of AI-assisted development work
- Final capstone project integrating all skills

## Output Format Required

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Alignment is Critical**: Every assessment must clearly map to specific LOs 
   and AIs. Every learning activity must support the assessments.

2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each module should build on previous ones, 
   increasing in cognitive demand per Bloom's taxonomy.

3. **Practical Focus**: Since this is a technical tool, 80% of learning time 
   should be hands-on practice with Claude Code.

4. **Real-World Context**: All examples and projects should reflect actual 
   development scenarios.

5. **Flexibility**: Design for both self-paced learning and instructor-led formats.

6. **Accessibility**: Ensure all materials can be adapted for different learning 
   styles and abilities.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Include reflection points where learners assess 
   their own progress.

## Success Criteria for This Course Design

The completed course structure should:
- ✅ Follow Backward Design principles rigorously
- ✅ Have clear, measurable LOs and AIs throughout
- ✅ Progress systematically through Bloom's taxonomy levels
- ✅ Align all assessments with LOs and AIs
- ✅ Include diverse, active learning experiences
- ✅ Prepare learners for real-world use of Claude Code
- ✅ Balance theoretical understanding with practical skills
- ✅ Support both novice and experienced developers
