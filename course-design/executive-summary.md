## Educational Foundation

The course is built on three proven educational frameworks:

1. **Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe)**
   - Starts with desired outcomes, then designs assessments, then activities
   - Ensures complete alignment throughout the course

2. **Outcome-Based Education (OBE)**
   - Every component has clear, measurable learning outcomes
   - Specific achievement indicators define success criteria
   - Focus on demonstrable skills, not just knowledge

3. **Bloom's Taxonomy Progression**
   - Systematic cognitive development from basic recall to advanced creation
   - Progressive complexity across modules
